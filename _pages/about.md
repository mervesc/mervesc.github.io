I am a security researcher, currently part of the SAP Security
Research team in France. Previously, I obtained my PhD in the Software&System
Security (S3) group at EURECOM, where I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher.
I have a wide
range of research interests including enterprise & web security, active defense , 
anomaly and fraud detection, and human factors in cyber-security. 

My PhD research focused on telecommunications fraud, and I had the opportunity
to present my work in various academic conferences (such as ACM CCS, NDSS, SOUPS), and also
industry-recognized venues (such as GSMA Fraud&Security group, M3AAWG, CCC).

At SAP, I am working on using active defense and deception techniques to engage with
attackers in the cloud landscape, and improving visibility into the application
runtime.
