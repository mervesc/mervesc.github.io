I am a security researcher, currently part of the [SAP Security
Research](https://www.sap.com/about/company/innovation/icn.html?pdf-asset=8c5580cc-207e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b&page=1) team in France. 
Previously, I obtained my PhD in the Software&System
Security (S3) group at [EURECOM](https://s3.eurecom.fr), where I also worked as a postdoctoral researcher.
I have a wide range of research interests including enterprise & web security, active defense, 
anomaly and fraud detection, and human factors in cyber-security. 

My PhD research focused on telecommunications fraud, and I had the opportunity
to present my work in various academic conferences (such as ACM CCS, NDSS, SOUPS), and also
industry-recognized venues (such as GSMA Fraud&Security group, M3AAWG, CCC).

At SAP, I am mainly working on web application security, including dynamic security
testing, and improving visibility into the application
runtime using active defense techniques and security-relevant logging. 
I have created the [AD&D Workshop](https://adnd.work) in 2022, to bring together 
the researchers working on active defense related topics.
